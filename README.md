# Console-based-half-Wordle
**Hello!**  
This mini-project attempts to make an elementary console version of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) using C++.  
There have been many simplifications. For eg: Any 5-letter string given as input is accepted, unlike the Actual Wordle, which will not accept any random 5-letter combo.
