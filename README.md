# Console-based-half-Wordle
**Hello!**  
This mini project was an attempt to make a very basic console version of Wordle using C++.  
There have been many simplifications. For eg: Any 5 letter string given as input is accepted, unlike the Actual Wordle which will not accept any random 5 letter combo.
